time complexity is the mathematical function that tales us  how the  time grows as the input grows -
function that gives us the relation ship about how the time will grow as the input grows -

linear 0(n) , binary log(n) , constant 0(1)- complexity :-

what do we consider which thinking about complexity :
1.always look for worst case complexity .
2.always look at complexity for large / infinity data / always look at the large amount of data
3. even tho value of actual time is deferment they are all growing linearly
   we don't care about actual time
4. 0( n3 + log() )
5. 0(1) < 0(log(n)) < 0(n) < n*log(n) < 0(2^N)

Big on notation :-
Big o mega :- opposite of Big on
